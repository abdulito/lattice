Getting a context when nothing is set:

```
$ lattice context get
lattice:
system:
```

Getting a context with only one variable set:

```
$ lattice context get
lattice: my-lattice
system:
```

Getting a context with both variables set:

```
$ lattice context get
lattice: my-lattice
system: my-system
```
