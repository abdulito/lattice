Rather than including the `--lattice` and `--system` flags with every command, you can set the lattice and system you are currently working on in the context. This is useful if you are issuing several commands in a row on the same lattice or system. The context stores the name of a lattice and/or a system to be passed into the `--lattice` and `--system` flags of commands as appropriate. You can always override the current context by manually setting the `--lattice` and/or `--system` flags.
