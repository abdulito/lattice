# XDS API

This library contains an implementation of the envoy v1 XDS API (https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/overview/v1_overview)

The v2 API (https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/overview/v2_overview.html) was just released, so we should write a new implementation to use v2, quite possibly as a backend to [envoyproxy/go-control-plane](https://github.com/envoyproxy/go-control-plane).
